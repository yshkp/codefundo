As during any natural calamity there is no electricity and many people could not find safe place and search for help.
Life savers mostly not able to locate people burried under building or anything. So my idea is to build an app that works on bluetooth it will create a list a people around it something like when they will open their app they connected in a chain and life savers would get the details of that person.
Client also using this app to get the names of a person around it so that he could find him and save him
It also does not need internet to be connected.
